Merging one branch into another
like a feature branch into a related master branch will leave you with all the commits from both as well as a Merge branch
 This maintains the hashes of all the feature branches commits. This way if git sees those commits again say from a branch
 that was based off of the original feature branch git will recognize those commits and resolve them easily.
